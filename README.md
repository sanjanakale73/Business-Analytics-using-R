# Predictive-Model-for-Marketing-using-R

A bank is marketing Certificates of Deposit (CD) to its existing customers. The bank estimates that 13% of them are likely to buy a CD if they are contacted. The cost of each contact is $10. The Net Present Value (NPV) to the bank of a customer buying a CD is $50. Clearly, it is not profitable to contact all the potential customers. So, the bank asks you to devise a classification model and predict whether or not a potential customer is a likely buyer before deciding whom to contact.
Therefore, your job is to help the firm to build a predictive model using historical data with 4,521 observations. Each observation records whether a customer bought the CD or not in variable y. The data set has various features that can be utilized as predictors.
