# Predictive Model for Marketing using R

## Introduction
This project is part of the "Business Analytics using R" course.

The objective of this project is to help a bank market Certificates of Deposit (CD) to its existing customers more effectively. The bank wants to predict whether a potential customer is likely to buy a CD before deciding whom to contact. By using a classification model, we can save costs and increase profitability by targeting only the most promising customers.

## Project Details
- The bank estimates that approximately 13% of its customers will likely buy a CD if contacted.
- Each contact costs $10, and the Net Present Value (NPV) of a customer buying a CD is $50.
- Our task is to build a predictive model using historical data consisting of 4,521 observations.
- Each observation records whether a customer bought the CD or not (variable y).
- The dataset contains various features that can be utilized as predictors.

## Dataset Description

## Benefits
- Cost Savings: Our predictive model significantly reduces marketing costs by targeting only potential CD buyers, minimizing expenses on less promising leads.

- Increased Profitability: By focusing on customers with a higher likelihood of purchasing a CD, our project maximizes returns on investment, leading to increased profitability for the bank.

- Improved Customer Engagement: Leveraging historical data and customer attributes, our project enables personalized marketing efforts, enhancing customer engagement and fostering long-term loyalty.

- Data-Driven Decision Making: Our project facilitates informed decision-making in the bank's marketing strategy by providing actionable insights on target customers, and optimizing resource allocation for more effective campaigns.
